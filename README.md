This code is created from the original project hosted by Microsoft at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application

It is used as a sample to migrate a MVC .Net Framework to .Net Core. This repository has been created because the original download link https://webpifeed.blob.core.windows.net/webpifeed/Partners/ASP.NET%20MVC%20Application%20Using%20Entity%20Framework%20Code%20First.zip is now broken.
